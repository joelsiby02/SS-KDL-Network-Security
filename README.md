# NSS KDL Project

This project analyzes the NSS KDL dataset and attempts to predict the likelihood of a student dropping out based on various features such as gender, age, and academic performance. The dataset contains information on over 10,000 students from various colleges in Kerala.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to explore the potential applications of the NSS KDL dataset in improving network security in real-time. Specifically, we aim to answer the question:

- How can we use the dataset to improve network security in real time? Can we build a model that can flag potentially malicious traffic and send alerts to network administrators as soon as possible?

This question is asking about the practical applications of the dataset in improving network security in real-time. The question is asking if it's possible to build a model using the dataset that can flag potentially malicious traffic and send alerts to network administrators immediately. The answer to this question can potentially help improve network security measures and prevent cyber-attacks.

# Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook and the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The NSS KDL dataset contains information on over 10,000 students from various colleges in Kerala. The dataset includes a variety of features such as gender, age, and academic performance. We will be using this dataset to explore the potential applications of machine learning in improving network security in real-time.
