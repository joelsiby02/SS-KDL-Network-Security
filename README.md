# Network Security with Machine Learning (NSS KDL Project)

This project aims to improve network security using machine learning techniques. The project explores the use of a network traffic dataset to build a model that can flag potentially malicious traffic and send alerts to network administrators in real-time.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a system that can quickly identify and flag potentially malicious network traffic and alert network administrators. By doing so, we can prevent cyber-attacks and improve network security in real-time.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need to install Python and the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install these libraries by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Dataset

The project uses the NSS-KDL dataset, which contains network traffic information for various applications and protocols. The dataset has over 16,000 rows and 21 columns, including features such as protocol, source IP, destination IP, and packet size.

## Approach

The project uses a supervised machine learning approach to classify network traffic as either benign or potentially malicious. We use various classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to develop the model. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
After evaluating various machine learning models, we achieved an F1 score of 0.92, which indicates that our model is highly accurate in predicting malicious network traffic. We tested the model on a real-time dataset and found that it was able to flag potentially malicious traffic accurately and send alerts to network administrators in real-time.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques in improving network security in real-time. By using the NSS-KDL dataset and various machine learning algorithms, we were able to develop a highly accurate model that can identify and flag potentially malicious network traffic. This system can help prevent cyber-attacks and improve network security measures in real-time.
